#What?

An skeleton project that shows how to generate a simple web app in a jar.

#Why?

Because:

* I don't want to install a webserver.
* I don't want to worry about runtime dependencies.
* I just want my app to be a single file.

#How?

To build: 

`mvn clean install`

To run: 

`java -jar target/myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

And that's pretty much it.
